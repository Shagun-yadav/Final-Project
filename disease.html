  <h2>1. Influenza</h2>
  <p><font size="4">
    Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses.
    Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue. It can lead to serious complications, especially in young children, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems<br>.
    Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza.
    <BR>
    Transmission: Influenza spreads mainly through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
    <br>
    Seasonality: Influenza activity is usually more common during the winter months in temperate regions, resulting in seasonal flu outbreaks. However, influenza can occur year-round in some areas and can also cause pandemics, as seen in historical outbreaks like the Spanish flu in 1918 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.

  <h2>2. Diabetes</h2>
  <p><font size="4">
    Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body regulates blood sugar levels.
    There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Symptoms may include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue.
    Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes, medication, and insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes.
    <br>
    Symptoms of diabetes can include frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, increased hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, slow healing of wounds, and recurrent infections. However, some people with Type 2 diabetes may not exhibit noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages.
    <br>
    If you suspect you have diabetes or have concerns about your health, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis, guidance, and treatment. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and help you manage the condition effectively.

  <h2>3. Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
  <p><font size="4">
    Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior.
    It is the most common cause of dementia. Early symptoms may include memory loss, confusion, and difficulty performing familiar tasks.
    Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but treatments and supportive care can help manage symptoms.<br>
    Causes: The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood. However, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Certain genetic mutations have been identified as risk factors, particularly in early-onset cases of the disease. Age is the biggest risk factor, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals over the age of 65.<br>
    If you or someone you know is experiencing memory problems or cognitive decline, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can provide appropriate guidance and support for managing the symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.

  <h2>4. CVD</h2>
  <P><font size="4">
      CVD stands for Cardiovascular Disease, which refers to a class of diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels. These diseases can include conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. CVD is a leading cause of death globally.
      <br>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of CVD and occurs when the blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis). This can restrict blood flow to the heart and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attacks, or other complications.<br>
      Several risk factors contribute to the development of CVD, including:

      High blood pressure (hypertension)
      High cholesterol levels
      Smoking
      Obesity
      Diabetes
      Sedentary lifestyle<br>
      Prevention and management of CVD involve a combination of lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication. Lifestyle modifications include adopting a heart-healthy diet (such as the Mediterranean diet), regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, and managing conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol through medication and regular medical check-ups.Prevention and management of CVD involve a combination of lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication.

  <h2>4. Malignant tumor</h2>
  <p><font size="4">
      A malignant tumor, also known as cancerous or cancerous tumor, is a mass of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade and spread to other parts of the body. These cells can grow uncontrollably and can interfere with the normal functioning of organs and tissues.
      <br>
      Unlike benign tumors, which are non-cancerous and generally do not spread to other areas of the body, malignant tumors have the potential to metastasize.The exact causes of malignant tumors can vary depending on the type of cancer. However, certain risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing cancer, including:
      <br>
      Genetic factors: Some individuals inherit genetic mutations that make them more susceptible to certain types of cancer.
      Environmental factors: Exposure to carcinogens such as tobacco smoke, radiation, certain chemicals, and pollutants can increase the risk of developing cancer.
      <br>

  <h2>5. Respiratory Disease</h2>
  <p><font size=" 4">
      Respiratory diseases are a group of medical conditions that affect the lungs and the respiratory system, which includes the airways, such as the trachea and bronchi, as well as the lung tissue itself. These diseases can range from mild, acute illnesses to chronic, debilitating conditions. Some common respiratory diseases include:Asthma,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung cancer,pneumonia, chronic bronchitis.<br>
      Prevention measures, such as avoiding smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, maintaining good indoor and outdoor air quality, practicing proper hygiene, and getting vaccinated against respiratory infections like influenza and pneumonia, can help reduce the risk of developing respiratory diseases.
      <br>
      If you have any concerns about respiratory symptoms or suspect you may have a respiratory disease, it is important to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
  </font></p>
  <h2>6.Anxiety</h2>
  <p><font size="4">
    Anxiety is a natural human response to stress or a perceived threat. It is a feeling of unease, worry, or fear about future events or uncertain outcomes. While it is normal to experience occasional anxiety, it becomes a problem when it becomes persistent, excessive, and starts interfering with daily life.
   <br>Types of Anxiety Disorders: Anxiety can manifest in various forms, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, and others.<br>Symptoms: Anxiety can have both physical and psychological symptoms. Physical symptoms may include rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, headaches, stomachaches, or muscle tension.<br>
   Causes: Anxiety disorders can arise from a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Traumatic events, major life changes, chronic medical conditions, substance abuse, or a family history of anxiety can contribute to the development of anxiety disorders.

  <h2>7. Corona Disease<font size="4"></h2><p>
    Corona disease, or more commonly known as COVID-19, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, leading to a pandemic.
    <br>
    COVID-19 primarily spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. It can also spread by touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, particularly the mouth, nose, or eyes.
    <br>
    The symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from mild to severe and may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, loss of taste or smell, and headache.  <br>
    Preventive measures to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19 include frequent handwashing with soap and water or using hand sanitizer, wearing face masks in public settings, practicing physical distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and following local health guidelines and regulations.

    COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized for emergency use in many countries, offering protection against the virus. Vaccination programs have played a significant role in reducing the severity of the disease and preventing hospitalizations and deaths.
    </p></font>
    <h2>8.Mononucleosis</h2>
    <p><font size="4">
      Mononucleosis (mono) is a contagious infection caused by a herpes virus called Epstein-Barr. Other viruses can also cause mono. The infection is common among teenagers and young adults. People with mono experience extreme fatigue, fever and body aches. Treatments can ease symptoms until the illness goes away on its own.
      <br>
      Symptoms of mono vary, and they can be mild or severe. They tend to come on gradually. If you get sick with mono, it will probably happen four to six weeks after you come in contact with EBV. These symptoms may last for four weeks or longer:

      Enlarged spleen or liver.
      Extreme fatigue.
      Fever.
      Headaches.
      Loss of appetite.
      Muscle aches or weakness.
      Rash.
      Sore throat.<br>
      There isn’t a vaccine or cure for mono. Antibiotics to fight bacterial infection and antiviral medications to kill other viruses don’t workh against mono. Instead, treatments focus on helping you feel better by relieving symptoms.<br>
      There’s no vaccine for mono. The best way to prevent getting the viruses that cause mono is by practicing good hygiene. Don’t share foods, drinks or bodily fluids with someone who has mono or any signs of viral illness, like fever, cough, sore throat or fatigue.

    <h2>9.Malaria</h2>
    <p><font size="4">
      Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills.
      <br>
      While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. Each year nearly 290 million people are infected with malaria, and more than 400,000 people die of the disease.<br>
      Signs and symptoms of malaria may include:
      Fever
      Chills
      General feeling of discomfort
      Headache
      Nausea and vomiting
      Diarrhea
      Abdominal pain
      Muscle or joint pain
      Fatigue
      Rapid breathing<br>Malaria is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.<br> Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. To protect yourself from mosquito bites, you should:

      Cover your skin. Wear pants and long-sleeved shirts. Tuck in your shirt, and tuck pant legs into socks.
      Apply insect repellent to skin. Use an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency on any exposed skin. Apply repellent to clothing. Sprays containing permethrin are safe to apply to clothing.
      Sleep under a net. Bed nets, particularly those treated with insecticides, such as permethrin, help prevent mosquito bites while you are sleeping.<br>
    </font></p>
    <h2>10.Pneumonia</h2>
    <p><font size="4">
    Pneumonia is inflammation and fluid in your lungs caused by a bacterial, viral or fungal infection. It makes it difficult to breathe and can cause a fever and cough with yellow, green or bloody mucus. The flu, COVID-19 and pneumococcal disease are common causes of pneumonia. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of pneumonia.   
    <br>We categorize pneumonia by which pathogen (virus, bacteria or fungi) caused it and how you got it — community-acquired, hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
    br>it’s important to seek medical attention for serious symptoms that could be signs of pneumonia, such as:
    Congestion or chest pain.
    Difficulty breathing.
    A fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.88 degrees Celsius) or higher.
    Coughing up yellow, green or bloody mucus or spit.<br>
    The best way to prevent pneumonia is to get vaccinated against bacteria and viruses that commonly cause it.
